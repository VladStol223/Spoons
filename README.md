# Spoons - The Energy Management App!
Spoons is a gamified productivity and energy-management tool designed to help you balance focus, energy, and task completion.
It’s inspired by the “spoon theory” — the idea that each person starts the day with a limited number of “spoons” (units of energy), and that each activity consumes or replenishes those spoons in different ways.

# Concept
Rather than just tracking tasks, Spoons helps you track energy flow across your day.

Each task costs a certain number of spoons to complete.
When your spoons run low, it’s a signal to rest, reset, or pick smaller tasks.
The app visually represents your available spoons, your active tasks, and your previously completed tasks - so productivity feels sustainable rather than forced.

# Core Features
## Task management
Create and organize tasks under six folders: Homework, Chores, Work, Misc, Exams, and Projects.
Each task stores details such as:
- Task Name
- Due Date
- Spoons necessary
  Optional details are:
- Description
- Start time
- Labels

## Save, Sync, and Account Controls
Includes:
- Optional cloud sync with Copyparty server backend.
- Buttons for Upload, Download, and Auto-Sync (visually disabled when not signed in).
- Local save state persists across sessions.

and whatever else I haven't added to this readme!
